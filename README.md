~ Page Developer/Programmer tasked with taking the given probelm(s) and its(their) requirement-guidelines to create, form, link and test the application's initial-files as well as logic-functionality between the user's front-end-terminol with node's package(s) and API(s) in the back end.

### [Problem / Concept:](https://github.com/UCF-Coding-Boot-Camp/UCF-LKM-FSF-PT-08-2019-U-C/blob/master/10-nodejs/02-Homework/Instructions/homework_instructions.md)
This Application's purpose is similar to Google's Siri in the sense of taking in a command (from a terminol's comand-line instead of speech/voice-recognition) and acting apropriately upon the command.

##### _This is orgoinized with a Switch-Statement taking in the command to send the apropriate url-choice with a function to log.txt each command with it's result_

#### Instructions:
1) Open GitBash or your preferance of Terminol
2) Navigate to this Repo's Directory
3) On a SINGLE comand line type out: 
* node liri.js _command_ _choice_ ++ENTER
* ##### Replace _command_ with one of the following:
    * ##### (Replace _choice_ with your choice of something to search with the command)
* spotify-this-song
    * (This will search your _choice_ song in spotify and display returned/relevant data)
* movie-this
    * (This will search your _choice_ movie in IMDB and display returned/relevant data)
* concert-this
    * (This will search your _choice_ band in BandsInTown and display returned/relevant data)
* do-what-it-says
    * (Leave _choice_ blank and this will read the random.txt file to return the results for one of the other 3 commands)

### Examples:
