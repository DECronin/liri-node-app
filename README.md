#### [Dana Cronin:](https://decronin.github.io/)
Page Developer tasked with taking the probelm and it's requirements/guidelines to create, form and test the app's files as well as logic-functionality.

### Problem / Concept:
This Application's purpose is similar to Google's Siri in the sense of taking in a command (from a terminol's comand-line instead of speech/voice-recognition) and acting apropriately upon the command.

##### _This is orgoinized with a Switch-Statement taking in the command to send the apropriate url-choice with a function to log.txt each command with it's result_

#### Instructions:
1) Open GitBash or your preferance of Terminol
2) Navigate to this Repo's Directory
3) On a SINGLE comand line type out: 
* node liri.js _command_ _choice_ ++ENTER
* ##### Replace _command_ with one of the following:
    * ##### (Replace _choice_ with your choice of something to search with the command)
* spotify-this-song
    * (This will search your _choice_ song in spotify and display returned/relevant data)
* movie-this
    * (This will search your _choice_ movie in IMDB and display returned/relevant data)
* concert-this
    * (This will search your _choice_ band in BandsInTown and display returned/relevant data)
* do-what-it-says
    * (Leave _choice_ blank and this will read the random.txt file to return the results for one of the other 3 commands)
